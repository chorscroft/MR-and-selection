Investigating food intake in relation to number of children

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(TwoSampleMR)
```


## Bread intake

```{r }
d <- make_dat("ukb-b-11348", "ieu-b-4760")
d_mr<-mr(d)
d_mr
mr_scatter_plot(d_mr,d)
```

```{r }
d <- make_dat("ieu-b-4760", "ukb-b-11348")
d_mr<-mr(d)
d_mr
mr_scatter_plot(d_mr,d)
```

Bread intake seems to be reverse causal.

## Cereal: Other

```{r }
d <- make_dat("ukb-d-1468_5", "ieu-b-4760")
d_mr<-mr(d)
d_mr
mr_scatter_plot(d_mr,d)
```

```{r }
d <- make_dat("ieu-b-4760", "ukb-d-1468_5")
d_mr<-mr(d)
d_mr
mr_scatter_plot(d_mr,d)
```

Food intake seems to be somewhat related to number of children, but it isn't massively strong and there's some evidence of reverse causality.

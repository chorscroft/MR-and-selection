Investigating health measures in relation to number of children fathered

```{r setup}
library(TwoSampleMR)
```

## Age started wearing glasses or contact lenses

```{r }
d <- make_dat("ukb-b-5801", "ukb-b-2227")
d_mr<-mr(d)
d_mr
mr_scatter_plot(d_mr,d)
```

```{r }
d <- make_dat("ukb-b-2227", "ukb-b-5801")
d_mr<-mr(d)
d_mr
mr_scatter_plot(d_mr,d)
```

Somewhat related, perhaps reverse causal or confounded by another factor?

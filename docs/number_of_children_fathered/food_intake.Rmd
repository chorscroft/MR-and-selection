Investigating food intake in relation to number of children fathered

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(TwoSampleMR)
```


## Bread intake

```{r }
d <- make_dat("ukb-b-11348", "ukb-b-2227")
d_mr<-mr(d)
d_mr
mr_scatter_plot(d_mr,d)
```

```{r }
d <- make_dat("ukb-b-2227", "ukb-b-11348")
d_mr<-mr(d)
d_mr
mr_scatter_plot(d_mr,d)
```

## Hot drink temperature

```{r }
d <- make_dat("ukb-b-14203", "ukb-b-2227")
d_mr<-mr(d)
d_mr
mr_scatter_plot(d_mr,d)
```

```{r }
d <- make_dat("ukb-b-2227", "ukb-b-14203")
d_mr<-mr(d)
d_mr
mr_scatter_plot(d_mr,d)
```

These intake measures seem to be somewhat related to number of children, but it isn't massively strong and there's some evidence of reverse causality or confounding.

Investigating SES measures in relation to number of children fathered

```{r setup}
library(TwoSampleMR)
```

## Degree

```{r }
d <- make_dat("ukb-b-16489", "ukb-b-2227")
d_mr<-mr(d)
d_mr
mr_scatter_plot(d_mr,d)
```
```{r }
d <- make_dat("ukb-b-2227", "ukb-b-16489")
d_mr<-mr(d)
d_mr
mr_scatter_plot(d_mr,d)
```

Having a degree is very strongly negatively related to having children. However, there is also evidence of reverse causality or confounding.

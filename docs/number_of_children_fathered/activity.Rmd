Investigating activity measures in relation to number of children fathered

```{r setup}
library(TwoSampleMR)
```

## Time spend outdoors in summer

```{r }
d <- make_dat("ukb-b-969", "ukb-b-2227")
d_mr<-mr(d)
d_mr
mr_scatter_plot(d_mr,d)
```

```{r }
d <- make_dat("ukb-b-2227", "ukb-b-969")
d_mr<-mr(d)
d_mr
mr_scatter_plot(d_mr,d)
```

## Driving faster than motorway speed limit

```{r }
d <- make_dat("ukb-b-4549", "ukb-b-2227")
d_mr<-mr(d)
d_mr
mr_scatter_plot(d_mr,d)
```

```{r }
d <- make_dat("ukb-b-2227", "ukb-b-4549")
d_mr<-mr(d)
d_mr
mr_scatter_plot(d_mr,d)
```

Both time spent outdoors in summer and driving faster than the motorway speed limit seem to be positively related to the number of children fathered.
